# SDN-Security-Project
Setting up and security evaluation of Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers using ODL, Mininet, SFlow-RT, SNORT

The goal of this project is to get started with a free and open-source SDN controller to understand the contributions of network management, automation, and configuration of a corporate network.

Also, this project analysis focuses on Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks on SDN  networks, in particular, it focuses SYN attack and communications protocol flood attacks. two detection and mitigation methods are projected by adding a light-weight detection and  mitigation mechanism at the controller to guard SDN switches and controller from DDoS attacks.

The project has the following main objectives:

➢ Setting up a Software Defined Networks using two virtual machines Mininet and 
Opendaylight controller.

➢ Show the impact of SYN flood DDoS attacks using Hping3

➢ DDoS Attack Detection and Mitigation using SFlow in SDN.

➢ Propose a second DDoS detection using SNORT IDS in SDN
